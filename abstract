For our semester final project, we are going to create a web based single player game. The game will be platform based and will be 
created using pyGame, a game development software specifically for python. Internet games have been popular ever since the internet
became widely available. We are hoping to create a game that will benefit from this popularity. Smooth gameplay, fun to look at exciting 
visuals, simple controls, and an endulging plotline are some of the main components that we believe make games great. Our plan is to take
these components and focus on them heavily in our game. Our target audience is anyone who plays video games, which is typically, but not
limited to, males in the age range 15-40. Our subject matter and visuals will appeal to this group as well as others outside of it. We 
are hoping to create something that is easy to pick up and play yet challenging enough to keep the user involved. If we focus on these
things we believe that our game can and will be successful.
